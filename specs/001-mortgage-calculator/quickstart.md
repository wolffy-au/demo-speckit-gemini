# Quick Start: Mortgage Calculator

**Feature Branch**: `001-mortgage-calculator`
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Spec**: specs/001-mortgage-calculator/spec.md

## Getting Started

This guide explains how to set up and run the Mortgage Calculator application locally.

The application follows a two-tier architecture:
*   **Backend**: A FastAPI application providing calculation endpoints.
*   **Frontend**: A Streamlit application for user interaction.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python**: Version 3.11 or higher recommended.
*   **Pip**: Python package installer.
*   **Git**: For managing the codebase.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    If you haven't already, clone the project repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Set up a Virtual Environment**:
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (e.g., using venv)
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    The project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management. Install backend and frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev] # Installs backend, frontend, and development dependencies
    ```
    *Note: `.[dev]` assumes `pyproject.toml` is configured to include dev dependencies for both backend and frontend.*

## Running the Application

### Start the Backend API (FastAPI)

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`:
    ```bash
    uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```
    *   This command starts the API server, making it accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
    *   `--reload` will automatically restart the server when code changes are detected.

### Start the Frontend UI (Streamlit)

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    *   This command starts the Streamlit server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

Once both the backend API and frontend UI are running:

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).
2.  Use the input fields to enter the known mortgage parameters (Loan Amount, Annual Interest Rate, Loan Term).
3.  Select the parameter you wish to calculate (e.g., "Monthly Payment").
4.  Click the calculate button.
5.  The result will be displayed on the page.

## Development Notes

*   **API Endpoints**: Refer to the API documentation (auto-generated by FastAPI, usually at `/docs` endpoint of the backend) for exact request/response formats.
*   **Calculation Logic**: The core P&I calculation logic is located in `backend/src/services/mortgage_calculator.py`.
*   **Testing**: Backend tests can be run using `pytest` within the `backend/src/tests/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly within your activated virtual environment.
*   **Port Conflicts**: If ports 8000 or 8501 are in use, adjust the `--port` argument for `uvicorn` or Streamlit accordingly.
*   **API Connection**: Verify that the frontend application is correctly configured to communicate with the backend API URL.
