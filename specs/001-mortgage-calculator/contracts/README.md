**Feature Branch**: `001-mortgage-calculator`
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Spec**: specs/001-mortgage-calculator/spec.md

## Purpose

This directory will house definitions for API contracts, schemas, and any other formal specifications related to the communication between the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Streamlit) components of the Mortgage Calculator.

## Current Status

No formal API contract definitions have been created yet. These will be added as the backend API and frontend integration points are solidified.

## Future Work

*   Define OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for the FastAPI endpoints.
*   Document request and response schemas for clarity and validation.
*   Establish clear communication protocols between the frontend and backend.
